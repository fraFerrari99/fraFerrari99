Hello to everyone! 

Despite my last name, I'm all about engineering software, not vehicles! üë®‚Äçüíª 

I'm Francesco Ferrari, a Python enthusiast specializing in Backend development (yeah I specify this since my FED skills are still sleeping)! üêç

I started working using Django and now I'm moving to FastAPI and I've navigated the Python roads with the finesse of a non-racing Ferrari! Obviously this is not real, my finesse is more similar to the Fiat Panda but we italians love this car! üöó 

Currently, I'm delving into the world of Azure Functions to expand my toolkit further and this is thanks to an opportunity that has come to work where I can mix both Azure Functions and FastAPI world!

## :hammer_and_wrench: My Languages and Tools 
In my first working experience I created a Geoportal using Django as the main technology, but the scope of the project was to give to the international clients that collected geographical data during time, the opportunity of seeing the stats related to their data.

So, aside from the web developing with Django, I also had the chance of using Pandas to analyze, clean, explore and manipulate the data collected; as database I used PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension that was used to work better with geographical data.

Now, I'm moved more in the Backend world focusing myself in the development of APIs using FastAPI and MongoDB as database. 

These are the technologies that I have used and that I am using:
