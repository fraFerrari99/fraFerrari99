Hi to everyone ðŸ‘‹


I'm Francesco Ferrari and I work as a Junior Python Developer at BcSoft Srl.

Right now I'm working on a project on climate change that is called AdriaClim and it consists in the creation of a Geoportal. ðŸ”­ 

It is created using Django with Python for the backend and Angular for the frontend and it is all dockerized.
Here's the link to the production website: https://geoportale-adriaclim.datamb.it/ 

Hope you like it and feel free to tell me everything thath you think it should be changed!
